# hello-world
#### THIS REPO IS SIMPLY FOR HELPING ME LEARN TO USE GITHUB. I AM NEW TO PROGRAMMING AND USING VERSION CONTROL PROGRAMS. I RECENTLY STARTED LEARNING TO USE GIT BECAUSE THE ATOM IDE HAS A BUILT IN VERSION THAT MAKES IT A BIT EASIER. WHILE USING IT ON THERE, I REALIZED HOW VALUABLE VCS REALLY ARE. 
** My name is Charles Wolfe. I am from New Orleans, LA. During the COVID-19 shutdown, I got bored and decided to start learning to code. The first language I came across when searching for " What language to learn " was python. So, needless to say, that is what I began learning. After about two weeks, I kind of slowed down. I was day trading to make money so almost all of my time was dedicated to finding trades. But around the end of May/beginning of June I started following the bootcamp course again. Two weeks into this second go around, I was hooked! Since then I haven't been able to stop. 

I really am so excited about learning about building software, cloud computing, virtual machines, blockchain, etc.. That I can't even focus on one thing. It really is so interesting to me. Now I am hoping to find a job in this field. I would honestly do anything to work for a SaaS company for the learning experience. I would seriously work for minimum wage, just so I can learn more.** 

I think this is good enough of an 'About Me' for the GitHub hello-world tutorial lol
